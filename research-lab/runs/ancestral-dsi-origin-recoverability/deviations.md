# Deviations from the preregistration

## D1 — 2026-10-22 04:32 NZDT — after the limb-1 results: the placebo cutoffs fail; post hoc checks

The preregistered RD gives a usable-share jump of +2.8 pp (−6.3 to +10.5) at 1 June 2023, so H1 is Inconclusive by
its rule. Placeholders rose by 9.0 pp (1.7 to 18.7) and absent fields fell by 11.9 pp (−16.0 to −8.5). But the
placebo cutoffs give jumps larger than the threshold in both directions: +17.3 pp at 1 June 2021 and −15.7 pp at 1
June 2022. The pooled daily series is dominated by shifts in who submits, most visibly pandemic-era SARS-CoV-2
surveillance, so a jump at any date mostly measures composition. Two checks, written after seeing this
(`code/analysis_rd_posthoc.py`):

1. the preregistered RD with SARS-CoV-2 samples (taxonomy 2697049) excluded, at the real and placebo cutoffs;
2. a within-submitter comparison: for organisations submitting in both windows, the change in their own shares,
   weighted by their samples, with an organisation-cluster bootstrap, at the real and placebo cutoffs.

H1's verdict stays the preregistered estimate's. The checks describe how far that estimate can be trusted.
